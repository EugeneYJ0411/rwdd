      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h3>
      <p>Simple, actionable steps to reduce your energy consumption at home or work.</p>
      <ul class="tips-list">
        <h4><li>Q1: What is EcoGlob?</li></h4>
        <p>EcoGlob is a community-focused web application designed to promote sustainable living practices
            in your area. It helps users find local recycling programmes, access energy-conservation tips,
            join community gardening projects, and swap eco-friendly products with others.</p>
        <h4><li>Q2: Who can join EcoGlob?</li></h4>
        <p>Anyone in the community can join EcoGlob — whether you’re a homeowner, renter, student, or part of
            a workplace. Once you register, you can explore the features, join projects, list items for swap,
            and engage with others.</p>
        <h4><li>Q3: Is there a cost to use EcoGlob?</li></h4>
        <p>No. EcoGlob is free to use for all registered users. Our aim is to make sustainable living accessible
            and engaging for everyone in the community.</p>
        <h4><li>Q4: How do I join a community gardening project?</li></h4>
        <p>Simply log in, navigate to the “Community Gardening” section, browse the available projects in your
            area, and click “Join” for the one you’re interested in. You’ll be notified if your participation 
            is confirmed.</p>
        <h4><li>Q5: How does the product swap feature work?</li></h4>
        <p>In the “Eco-Friendly Product Swap” section, you can list items you no longer need (provided they are
            reusable and eco-friendly), browse items listed by others, and connect to swap. You’ll handle the
            swap arrangement (meet-up or drop-off) directly with the other user.</p>
        <h4><li>Q6: How do I find information about local recycling programmes?</li></h4>
        <p>Go to the “Recycling Programs” section in our homepage, enter your postcode or locality,
            and you’ll see a list of programmes, collection schedules, locations, and guidelines on
            how to participate in each.</p>
        <h4><li>Q7: Can I save favourite energy-conservation tips?</li></h4>
        <p>Yes. Under “Energy Conservation Tips,” you can browse all tips and mark ones you’d like to save or
            refer back to later in your personal profile or dashboard.</p>
        <h4><li>Q8: Is my data safe on EcoGlob?</li></h4>
        <p>Absolutely. We take user privacy seriously. Your personal details are stored securely, and any public
            contributions (e.g., swap listings or gardening project posts) only display what you choose. Be sure
            to review our Privacy Policy for full details.</p>
